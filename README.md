# Float, an MD based knowledgebase
Host the server, connect, make documents, everything is saved as MD files. Nothing is deleted permanently unless the files themselves are removed from the server.
Create templates, and new documents can use them as a base.

I found docusaurus while I was working on this, but decided to finish it to a mostly functional point because Docusaurus still doesn't have a native file editor.

Mostly feature complete, still a few formatting bugs, but I think it's pretty safe to run if you need a simple documentation database.
