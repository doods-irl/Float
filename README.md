# Float
Host the server, connect, make documents, everything is saved as MD files. Nothing is deleted permanently unless the files themselves are removed from the server.

I found docusaurus while I was working on this, but decided to finish it to a mostly functional point because Docusaurus still doesn't have a native file editor.

Mostly feature complete, still a few formatting bugs, but I think it's pretty safe to run if you need a documentation database.
